Go Server Project Boilerplate

# Usage

You should create a new repository from this template to best use this boilerplate.

1- Click on the "Use this template" button to create a new repository.

> **Note:** Choose the repository name carefully as it will be used as the go module name and all the binaries by default.

2- Clone the repository you've created from this template.

3- Run the `replace-module-name.sh` script to replace the module name in the project.

```bash
./replace-module-name.sh
```

4- Run the `scripts/build.sh` script to build the project.

5- Remove the `replace-module-name.sh` script. Should no longer be needed.

6- Commit the changes and push them to the repository.
